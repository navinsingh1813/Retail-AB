## Calendar Date Wise Sales Dashboard Overview

### 1. Quantity Sales by Year

**Visual Used: Line Chart**

**Description**: The line chart on the top left displays the monthly trend of product quantities sold throughout the year. It provides a clear view of the fluctuations in sales volume, showing peaks and dips for each month.

*Key Observations*:

- **January**: 0.06M units sold.
- **March**: Peaks at **0.11M** units, indicating strong sales.
- **June**: Moderate sales at **0.09M** units.
- **December**: Another high point with **0.19M** units sold.

This trend shows a rise in sales from March to June, a dip around July and August, and then a steady increase until December. Such a visual is useful for identifying high and low-performing months at a glance.

### 2. Total Sales by FY-Year

**Visual Used: Line Chart**

**Description**: The line chart below the quantity trend visualizes **Total Sales** by **Fiscal Year (FY)**. This helps in understanding long-term trends over multiple years, highlighting growth or decline patterns.

**Fiscal Year Sales**:

- **FY 2019-2020: 0.64M**
- **FY 2020-2021: 0.61M**

The fiscal year sales show significant growth between 2018 and 2020, peaking at 0.64M. However, a slight drop in the following year indicates a minor decline in total sales performance.

### 3. Total Sales by Quarter

**Visual Used: Bar Chart**

**Quarterly Sales:**

- **Q2: 0.27M**
- **Q1: 0.22M**

### 4. Year-wise Total Sales and Ship Date Sales

**Visual Used: Matrix Table**

**Description:** The matrix table on the top-right corner presents a detailed year-wise breakdown of **Total Sales** and **Ship Date Sales** for each year. This type of visual is ideal for showing structured data with specific details.

### 5. Order and Ship Date Sales by Year

**Visual Used: Stacked Bar Chart**

**Description:** The stacked bar chart on the bottom-right compares **Order Sales** and **Ship Date** Sales for 2019 and 2020. This type of visual is effective for comparing two related metrics over the same category, in this case, "Year."

**Sales Comparison:**
